## Vision

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive tool that helps artists manage their projects with ease and creativity. Key features include:

- **Visual and Textual Integration:** Incorporate images, sketches, and rich text to create detailed project descriptions and progress updates.
- **Dynamic Views:** Toggle between different views, such as a calendar view and a scrapbook view, to visualize project timelines and progress.
- **Enhanced Functionality:** Implement features like tagging, search, pagination, and authentication to improve usability and user experience.

## Features Implemented

- **Deployment:** Deployed on Vercel for continuous integration.
- **Tagging and Search:** Implemented tagging and search functionality for efficient navigation through projects.
- **Dynamic Calendar View:** Introduced a calendar view that toggles between general tasks and day-by-day project progress.
- **Pagination and Accessibility:** Added pagination and accessibility features to enhance user experience.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Implemented dynamic rendering to improve performance and interactivity.
- **Authentication:** Integrated OAuth for user authentication (temporarily not active).

## Features in Progress

- **CRUD for Artifacts:** Implementing full CRUD functionality for artifacts (resources/images), including image uploads.
- **Layout for Scrapbook Concept:** Finalizing the layout for the scrapbook view and toggling between views.
- **OAuth Integration:** Re-integrating OAuth for secure user authentication.
- **Animations:** Planning and implementing animations to enhance user interaction.
- **Rich Text Editor:** Utilized Quill.js for a feature-rich Markdown editor, supporting various text formatting options.
- **Image and Sketch Integration:** Incorporated an HTML5 Canvas for seamless inclusion of artistic content.
- **Updating various placeholders:** The pictures for the artifacts need to be updated to at least be my own pictures.

## Future Plans

- **Embeds from Various Websites:** Integrate embeds from platforms like Pinterest, Twitter/X, and Pixiv.
- **Chatbox Command Interface:** Develop a chatbox-like way to add content, possibly using a CLI-type format for commands.
- **Expanded Tagging:** Enhance the tagging system for better project categorization and searchability.
- **Payment Integration:** Plan for Stripe/payment integration to charge for storage and additional features.
- **Cloud Storage Providers:** Integrate with cloud storage providers for extended storage options.
- **Account Setup:** Expand account setup options for a more personalized user experience.
- **Image Compression:** I think this would just be interesting to look into.
- **Mobile integration:** I want to be able to pull this up on my phone and send links here.

## Personal Note (Deeper vision?)

I store everything in a personal Discord server because I appreciate being able to access stuff from both PC and mobile, and the infinite storage (despite image compression). I like using channels and channel categories, the chat UI, and the automatic embeds for Twitter and other websites, which makes it easy to save references and pictures for inspiration. I want an app with similar functionality to Pinterest but with the ability to go offline, or at the very least browse without being bogged down by recommendation algorithms and layouts that seem to cater more to advertisers than to the end user.
